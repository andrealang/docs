# ASP.NET Core
{: #dotnet_core}

The ASP.NET Core runtime on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} is powered by the ASP.NET Core buildpack. ASP.NET Core
is a modular open source framework for building .NET web applications.
.Net Core is a small, cross-platform runtime that can be targeted by ASP.NET Core applications.
They combine to enable modern, cloud-based web applications.
{: shortdesc}

## Detection
{: #detection}
The Bluemix ASP.NET Core buildpack is used if there are one or more folders containing both a project.json and at least one .cs file anywhere in the application,
 or if the application is pushed from the output directory of the *dotnet publish* command.

## Starter application
{: #starter_application}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} provides an ASP.NET Core starter application.  The ASP.NET Core starter application is a simple app that provides a template that you can use. You can experiment with the starter app, and make and push changes to the Bluemix environment.  See [Using the starter applications](/docs/cfapps/starter_app_usage.html) for help with using the starter application.

## Runtime versions
{: #runtime_versions}

### Supported versions
{: #supported_versions}
This buildpack supports the following versions, those marked as deprecated will be removed in a future buildpack release.  See [Microsoft's support statement for LTS and Current releases](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/support).

#### project.json tooling (deprecated)

| .NET SDK version        | Default |
|-------------------------|---------|
| 1.0.0-preview2-003156   |   No    |
| 1.0.0-preview2-1-003177 |   No    |

#### MSBuild SDK tooling

| .NET SDK version        | Default |
|-------------------------|---------|
| 1.0.0-preview4-004233   |   No    |
| 1.0.1                   |   Yes   |

#### .NET Core runtime versions

| .NET Core runtime version | Release type | Default |
|---------------------------|--------------|---------|
| 1.0.0                     | LTS          |   No    |
| 1.0.1                     | LTS          |   No    |
| 1.0.3                     | LTS          |   No    |

| 1.1.1                     | Current      |   No    |

### Specifying the .NET SDK version

Control the .NET SDK version with an optional global.json in the application's root directory. For example:
```
   {
      "projects": [ "src" ],
      "sdk": {
        "version": "1.0.1"
      }
   }
```
{: codeblock}

If not specified, the MSBuild tooling for the latest Long-term-support (LTS) runtime is used.  To use project.json tooling, you can specify one of the project.json versions listed above but should also keep in mind that these versions will be removed in the future.

## Customizing NuGet package sources
{: #customizing_nuget_package_sources}

Control where your application's dependencies are downloaded from in the NuGet.Config file in the application's root directory. For example:
```
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <configuration>
   <packageSources>
      <add key="NuGet.org" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json"/>
   </packageSources>
   </configuration>
```
{: codeblock}

## Developing applications locally
{: #developing_locally}

For more information about running an ASP.NET Core application locally, see
[Getting Started with ASP.NET](http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/getting-started/index.html).
To most closely match how the application runs in Bluemix, follow the Linux instructions for .NET Core, but developing the application on Linux is not required.

The Yeoman tool can be used to generate new project templates as described in
[Building Projects with Yeoman](http://docs.asp.net/en/latest/client-side/yeoman.html).

For information about developing locally using Visual Studio, see [Developing with Visual Studio](/docs/starters/deploy_vs.html){: new_window}.

## Pushing a Published Application
{: #pushing_published_app}

If you want your application to contain all its required binaries so that the buildpack does not download any
external binaries, you can push a published *self-contained* application.  See [.NET Core App Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/app-types){: new_window}
for more information on self-contained applications.

To publish an application issue a command such as:
```
  dotnet publish -r ubuntu.14.04-x64
```
{: codeblock}

For self-contained applications, the app can then be pushed from the
```
  bin/<Debug|Release>/<framework>/<runtime>/publish
```
{: codeblock}
directory.

For portable applications, the app can be pushed from the
```
  bin/<Debug|Release>/<framework>/publish
```
{:codeblock}
directory.

Also note that if you are using a manifest.yml file in your application, you can specify the path to the publish output folder in your manifest.yml.  Then you don't have to be in that folder when you push the application.

## Deploying apps with multiple projects
{: #developing_apps_with_multiple_projects}

To deploy an app which contains multiple projects, you will need to specify which project you want the buildpack to run as the main project. This can be done by creating a .deployment file in the root folder of the solution which sets the path to the main project. The path to the main project can be specified as the project folder or the project file (.xproj or .csproj).

For example if a solution which contains three projects, *MyApp.DAL*, *MyApp.Services*, and *MyApp.Web* in the *src* folder, and *MyApp.Web* is the main project, the format of the .deployment file would be as follows:
```
  [config]
  project = src/MyApp.Web/MyApp.Web.csproj
```
{: codeblock}

In this example, the buildpack would automatically compile the *MyApp.DAL* and *MyApp.Services* projects if they are listed as dependencies in the project.json file for *MyApp.Web*, but the buildpack would only attempt to execute the main project, *MyApp.Web*, with dotnet run -p src/MyApp.Web.

## Application Configuration
{: #application_configuration}

### Configuring your application to listen on the proper port
{: #configuring_listen_proper_port}

The buildpack will run your application with the *dotnet run* command and pass the command-line argument that follows
```
  --server.urls http://0.0.0.0:${PORT}
```
{: codeblock}

Your application will need to pass this argument to kestrel to ensure that kestrel is listening on the correct port.

To implement the passing of this argument, the samples provided in the cli-samples repository and the templates provided by Visual Studio will
require slight modifications before deploying to Bluemix.

Modifications are required to the Main method as noted by the comments in the example below:

<pre>
  public static void Main(string[] args)
  {
    var config = new ConfigurationBuilder() //ADD THESE 3 LINES AT THE TOP OF THE MAIN METHOD
        .AddCommandLine(args)
        .Build();

    var host = new WebHostBuilder()
        .UseKestrel()
        .UseConfiguration(config) //ADD THIS LINE BEFORE 'UseStartup'
        .UseStartup&lt;Startup&gt;()
        .Build();
    host.Run();
}
</pre>
{: codeblock}

For project.json tooling, add this line to your project.json file:
```
  "Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.CommandLine": "1.0.1",
```
{: codeblock}

For MSBuild tooling, add this line to your .csproj file:
```
  <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.CommandLine" Version="1.0.1" />
```
{:codeblock}

Add a *using* statement to the file which contains your Main method:
```
  using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
```
{: codeblock}

### Ensure your application has all of the files needed in the build output folder
{: #configure_output_files}

#### Using project.json tooling

Add the following property to the `buildOptions` section of project.json:
```
  "copyToOutput": {
    "include": [
      "wwwroot",
      "Areas/**/Views",
      "Views",
      "appsettings.json"
    ]
  }
```
{: codeblock}

In Startup.cs `Startup` method, remove the following line:
```
  .SetBasePath(env.ContentRootPath)
```
{: codeblock}

In Program.cs `Main` method, remove the following line:
```
  .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
```
{: codeblock}

These changes should allow the .NET CLI to find your application's `Views` as they will now be copied to the build output when the `dotnet run` command executes.  If your application has any other files, such as json configuration files, which are required at runtime then you should also add those to the `include` section of `copyToOutput` in the project.json file for your project.

#### Using MSBuild tooling

Add a `<Content>` element to the `<ItemGroup>` element of your .csproj file:
```
  <ItemGroup>
    <Content Include="wwwroot/**/*;Areas/**/Views/*;Views/*;appsettings.json">
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
      <CopyToPublishDirectory>Always</CopyToPublishDirectory>
    </Content>
  </ItemGroup>
```
{: codeblock}

In Startup.cs `Startup` method, remove the following line:
```
  .SetBasePath(env.ContentRootPath)
```
{: codeblock}

In Program.cs `Main` method, remove the following line:
```
  .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
```
{: codeblock}

These changes should allow the .NET CLI to find your application's `Views` as they will now be copied to the build output when the `dotnet publish` command executes.  If your application has any other files, such as json configuration files, which are required at runtime then you should also add those to the `Include` property of the `Content` element in the .csproj file for your project, separated by semi-colons.

## Compiling your application in Release configuration (MSBuild only)
{: #compiling_in_release_configuration}

MSBuild based projects are now published using the `dotnet publish` command during staging.  By default, the buildpack will publish your application in `Debug` configuration.
To publish your application in `Release` configuration, set the `PUBLISH_RELEASE_CONFIG` environment variable to `true`.

You can do this with the CloudFoundry CLI with the following command:

```shell
  cf set-env <app_name> PUBLISH_RELEASE_CONFIG true
```

Alternatively, you can set the variable in your application's manifest.yml file:

```yml
---
applications:
- name: sample-aspnetcore-app
  memory: 512M
  env:
    PUBLISH_RELEASE_CONFIG: true
```

## Disabling the NuGet Package Cache
{: #disabling_the_nuget_package_cache}

In some situations it may be necessary to clear the NuGet package cache for your application.  Doing so will clear any existing cached NuGet packages and prevent the buildpack from caching any new packages.

You can do this by setting the `CACHE_NUGET_PACKAGES` environment variable to `false` using the CloudFoundry CLI:

```shell
  cf set-env <app_name> CACHE_NUGET_PACKAGES false
```

Alternatively, you can set the `CACHE_NUGET_PACKAGES` environment variable to `false` in your application's manifest.yml file:

```yml
---
applications:
- name: sample-aspnetcore-app
  memory: 512M
  env:
    CACHE_NUGET_PACKAGES: false
```

## Using Custom Native Libraries
{: #using_custom_native_libraries}

Some libraries may require you to use both a NuGet package and some native library files (.so files).  In order to use these libraries with the buildpack, you should place them in a folder named "ld_library_path" in the root folder of your application.
The buildpack will automatically add this path to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable during staging.  Alternatively, you can specify the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable in your application's `manifest.yml` file or using the `cf set-env` command to use a different folder name than "ld_library_path".  In this case, the buildpack will append this custom path to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` generated by the buildpack.

## Troubleshooting FAQ
{: #troubleshooting_faq}

**Q**: My application fails to deploy with the message: `API/0App instance exited ... payload: {... "reason"=>"CRASHED", "exit_status"=>-1, ...}`.  What does this mean?

**A**: If you are receiving a similar message when pushing your application it is most likely caused by your application exceeding either the memory or disk quota limits.  This can be resolved by increasing the quotas for your application.

**Q**: My application fails to deploy with the message: `Failed to compress droplet: signal: broken pipe` or `No space left on device`.  How can I fix this?

**A**: Projects pushed from source code which contain a large number of NuGet package dependencies can sometimes cause this error when the NuGet package cache is enabled.  Set the `CACHE_NUGET_PACKAGES` environment variable to `false` to disable the cache.
