Error: /app/node_modules/bluemix-autoscaling-agent/node_modules/appmetrics/appmetrics.node: invalid ELF header
    at Error (native)
    at Object.Module._extensions..node (module.js:597:18)
    at Module.load (module.js:487:32)
    at tryModuleLoad (module.js:446:12)

    at Function.Module._load (module.js:438:3)
    at Module.require (module.js:497:17)
    at require (internal/module.js:20:19)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/app/node_modules/bluemix-autoscaling-agent/node_modules/appmetrics/index.js:25:13)
    at Module._compile (module.js:570:32)
    at Object.Module._extensions..js (module.js:579:10)
