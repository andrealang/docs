## Installing developer tools
{: #dev_tools}

Ensure that you have installed the [prerequisite developer tools ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](get_code.html#prereq-dev-tools){: new_window}.

4. Begin working with your downloaded project:

	1. Expand the archived file.
	
	2. Navigate to the new project directory.
	
	3. Use the {{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_notm}} to proceed.

5. Optional: [Update your project](project_overview_page.html#update_language) to generate a new language.


## Creating a project using the {{site.data.keyword.dev_cli_notm}}
{: #create-cli}
