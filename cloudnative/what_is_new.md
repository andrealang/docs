   * The **Authentication** tab has been renamed to **User Access** tab.


### Code
{: #code notoc}

   * The generated Objective-C and Swift code for iOS now uses CocoaPods to manage dependencies. This means that you need to install CocoaPods. To install it, run `sudo gem install cocoapods`. After CocoaPods is installed, run `pod setup` to configure it (if not configured already). Finally, run `pod install` to download and install the required project dependencies prior to opening your `.xcworkspace` file in Xcode. Additional details are available in the `README.md` file in the downloaded code archive. Read about [Prerequisite Developer Tools](get_code.html#prereq-dev-tools) for more information.
