# What is {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}?
{: #bluemixoverview}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} is {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}'s innovative cloud computing platform that combines platform as a service (PaaS) with infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Additionally, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} has a rich catalog of cloud services that can be easily integrated with PaaS and IaaS to build business applications rapidly.
{:shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} has cloud deployments that fit your needs whether you are a small business that plans to scale, or a large enterprise that requires additional isolation. You can develop in a cloud without borders, where you can connect your private services to the public {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services available from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}. You and your team can access the apps, services, and infrastructure in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} and use existing data, systems, processes, PaaS tools, and IaaS tools. Developers can tap into the rapidly growing ecosystem of available services and runtime frameworks to build applications using polyglot programming approaches.
 
With {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}, you no longer have to make large investments in hardware to test out or run a new app. Instead, we manage it all for you and only charge for what you use. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} provides public, [dedicated](/docs/dedicated/index.html), and [local](/docs/local/index.html) integrated deployment models. 

You can take an idea from inception, to development sandbox, to a globally distributed production environment with compute and storage infrastructure, open source platform services and containers, and software services and tools from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, Watson, and more. Beyond the capabilities of the platform itself, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} also provides flexible deployment. Provision {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix}} resources on-premises, in dedicated private cloud environments, or in the public cloud, and manage the resources from all three types of environments in a single dashboard.
 
All {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} cloud resources that are deployed in public and dedicated environments are hosted from your choice of {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCent}} locations around the world. {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCents_notm}} provide regional redundancy, a global network backbone connecting all data centers and points of presence, and stringent security controls and reporting. Through {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCents_notm}}, {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} can meet your most demanding expansion, security, compliance, and data residency needs. 

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} enables you to:

* Deploy high performance compute and storage infrastructure in secure {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCents_notm}} around the world.
* Test and adopt a broad range of cloud services and capabilities from {{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}}, open source communities, and third-party developers.
* Connect to all of your legacy systems and apps from a single, scalable, cloud platform through private network and API capabilities.
* Spin up and turn down resources in real time as your business needs or workload demands change.

## Apps
{: #bluemixoverviewapplications}

The Apps dashboard provides everything you need to get your apps up and running, and to manage those apps while they run. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} provides various boilerplates and runtimes:

* A boilerplate is a template for an application and its associated runtime environment and predefined services for a specific domain. 
* A runtime is the set of resources that is used to run an app, provided as containers for different types of apps.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} provides various ways for you to run your apps, for example, Cloud Foundry and {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}}. Use {{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} to run Docker containers in a hosted cloud environment on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. 

You can use {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk}} for distributed, event-driven computing. {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} runs application logic in response to events or direct invocations from web or mobile apps over HTTP.
 
You can use {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Mobile services to incorporate pre-built, managed, and scalable cloud services into your mobile apps. 

## Services
{: #bluemixoverviewservices}

## Infrastructure
{: #bluemixoverviewinfrastructure}

The Infrastructure dashboard provides various services to fit your cloud infrastructure needs.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure provides the highest performing cloud infrastructure available. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure is one platform, which takes data centers around the world that are full of the widest range of cloud computing options, then integrates and automates everything. {{site.data.keyword.CloudDataCents_notm}} are filled with first class computing, storage, and networking gear. Each location is built, outfitted, and operated in the same way, so you get exactly the same capabilities and availability anywhere where we are present. Locations are connected by the industryâ€™s most advanced network-in-a-network, which integrates distinct public, private, and internal management networks to deliver lower total networking costs, better access, and higher speed. Also, the data centers and network share a single proprietary management system. One management tool lets you control everything--every bare metal server, virtual server, and storage device--all accessible by API, portal, and mobile applications.

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure offers powerful bare metal servers and flexible virtual servers in a single seamless platform. All are provided on demand and billed on monthly or hourly terms. Bare metal servers provide the raw horsepower for your processor-intensive and disk I/O-intensive workloads and can be configured to your exact specifications. Virtual servers allow for high speed of deployment, flexible scalability, and pay-as-you-go billing. For high performance computing, give your cloud a boost with graphics processing unit (GPU) servers, available by the hour or monthly. 

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} infrastructure offerings are connected to a three-tiered network, segmenting public, private, and management traffic. Infrastructure on a customer's {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} account might transfer data between such infrastructure across the private network at no cost. Infrastructure offerings, such as bare metal servers, virtual servers, and cloud storage, connect to other applications and services in the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog, such as Watson services, containers, or runtimes, across the public network. Data transfer between those two types of offerings is metered and charged at standard public network bandwidth rates.
