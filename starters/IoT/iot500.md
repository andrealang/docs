# Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} Starter
{: #gettingstartedtemplate}
<!-- Provide and appropriate ID above -->

Get started with {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} by using the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} Starter boilerplate. By using the Starter, you can quickly simulate a device, create cards, generate data, and begin analyzing and displaying data in the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard.
{:shortdesc}

The Starter automatically deploys and connects these services:

- **{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}** - An IoT toolkit that includes gateway  management, device management, and application access. By using {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}, you can collect connected device data and run analytics on real-time data from your organization.

- **{{site.data.keyword.sdk4nodefull}}** - The runtime environment in which Node-RED runs.

- **{{site.data.keyword.cloudantfull}}** - The database in which Node-RED stores metadata.

## About {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}
{: #about_iotplatform}
{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} provides powerful application access to IoT devices and data to help you rapidly create analytics applications, visualization dashboards, and mobile IoT apps.
You can use {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} to perform powerful device management operations, store and access device data, and connect a wide variety of devices and gateway devices. {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} provides secure communication to and from your devices by using MQTT and TLS.

## About Node-RED
{: #about_nodered}
Node-RED is a tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs, and online services in new and interesting ways.  You can use Node-RED to create a simulated thermostat that sends simulated data to your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} service. You can create cards to display real-time data in the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard. For more information, see the [Node-RED documentation](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/Node-RED/nodered.html#nodered).

## Before you begin

Before you begin, you must deploy an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} Starter in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}
 organization. Deploying an instance automatically deploys the component applications and services of the starter.

 You can [find the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} starter](https://console.{DomainName}/catalog/starters/internet-of-things-platform-starter/) in the Boilerplates section of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} catalog.

## Deploying the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} Starter
{: #deployStarter}

Perform the following steps to deploy the Starter:

1. Create the boilerplate:
  1. Log in to or register for Bluemix at https://www.bluemix.net.
  2.	Select the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} Starter boilerplate.
       - Open the catalog by selecting Blue + or by selecting the catalog tab.
       - Select the Boilerplate category.
       - Select the Internet of Things Platform Starter boilerplate.
  3. On the Internet of Things Platform Starter page, verify the selections for **Create an app**.  In this scenario, the following values are entered:
    -	Space: dev
    - Name: myIoTApp
    - Host: myIoTApp
  4. Click **Create** to add Node-RED to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} organization.
2.	Keep the default values for the rest of the options. After the application is deployed, the Getting Started with {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} Starter page is displayed.  *Note*: The staging process might take a few minutes.

## Getting Around
{: #gettingaround}
To make moving between tasks easier, open the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard, the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard, and the Node-RED application in three different tabs in your browser.
  - *{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard* - See the state of your deployment, read documentation, and launch the dashboards.
  - *{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard* - Define device types, register devices, monitor incoming sensor data, create data visualization cards, and see live data visualizations.
  - *Node-RED* - Configure and run the device simulator flow and work with other flows to process data from {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}.

    1.	In your Node-RED flow editor, double-click the gray **Send Data** node, set the Repeat value to **Interval**, and set the frequency to every **3** seconds.
    2. Click **Done**.
    3. Deploy your changes by clicking **Deploy**.

  - [Search the IoT Recipes](https://developer.ibm.com/recipes/?post_type=tutorials&s=watson+iot) to connect a physical device such as a Raspberry Pi and send data to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}.

  - [Deploy a sample node.js application to visualize device data.](https://www.bluemix.net/docs/services/IoT/visualizingdata_sample.html)

  -	Password protect the Node-RED flow editor. By default, the editor is open for anyone to access and modify flows. To password-protect the editor, perform the following tasks:
    1.	In the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} dashboard, click the name of your Starter application to open the application pages.
    2. Click **Runtime** to display the Runtime page.
    3. Click **Environment variable** to display the Environment Variables page.
    4. In the **User Defined** section, click **Add** and then enter the following user-defined variables:
         -	NODE_RED_USERNAME - the user name to secure the editor
         -	NODE_RED_PASSWORD - the password to secure the editor
