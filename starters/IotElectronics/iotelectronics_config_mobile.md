Before you can use the mobile app, you must deploy an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics}} starter in your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} organization. Deploying an instance of the starter automatically deploys the component applications and services of the starter.

To get started with the mobile app, complete the following tasks:
1. [Download the mobile app](#iot4e_downloadmobile) to your mobile device.
2. [Connect the mobile app to the {{site.data.keyword.iotelectronics}} environment](#iot4e_connecting_mobile) and register your appliances.
