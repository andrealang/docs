# {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI

{{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} offers a powerful command line interface that allows complete management of all aspects of the system.

## Setting up the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI 

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} command line interface (CLI) to set up your namespace and authorization key.
Go to [Configure CLI](https://new-console.{DomainName}/openwhisk/cli){: new_window} and follow the instructions to install it.

There are two required properties to configure in order to use the CLI:

1. **API host** (name or IP address) for the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} deployment you want to use.
2. **Authorization key** (username and password) which grants you access to the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} API.

Run the following command to set the API host:

```
wsk property set --apihost openwhisk.ng.bluemix.net
```
{: pre} 

If you know your authorization key, you can configure the CLI to use it. 

Run the following command to set the Authorization key:

```
wsk property set --auth <authorization_key>
```
{: pre}

**Tip:** The OpenWhisk CLI stores the properties set in `~/.wskprops` by default. The location of this file can be altered by setting the `WSK_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable. 

To verify your CLI setup, try [creating and running an action](./index.html#openwhisk_start_hello_world).

## Using the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI

After you have configured your environment, you can begin using the {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}} CLI to do the following:

* Run your code snippets, or actions, on {{site.data.keyword.openwhisk_short}}. See [Creating and invoking actions](./openwhisk_actions.html).
* Use triggers and rules to enable your actions to respond to events. See [Creating triggers and rules](./openwhisk_triggers_rules.html).
* Learn how packages bundle actions and configure external events sources. See [Using and creating packages](./openwhisk_packages.html).
* Explore the catalog of packages and enhance your applications with external services, such as a [Cloudant event source](./openwhisk_cloudant.html). See [Using OpenWhisk-enabled services](./openwhisk_catalog.html).

## Configure the CLI to use an HTTPS proxy

The CLI can be setup to use an HTTPS proxy. To setup an HTTPS proxy, an environment variable called `HTTPS_PROXY` must be created. The variable must be set to the address of the HTTPS proxy, and its port using the following format:
`{PROXY IP}:{PROXY PORT}`.
