## Cloud Automation Manager known issues
{: #knownissues}

- If you deploy multiple instances with the same SSH key content to the SoftLayer environment, an issue occurs when trying to delete the instances.
- The template deployment to a vSphere cloud provider fails with the following error:
 ```
 Error setting up client: Post https://192.0.2.20/sdk: x509: cannot validate certificate for 192.0.2.20 because it doesn't contain any IP SANs
 ```
 To solve the problem, specify the following parameter in the `provider` section:
 ```
 provider "vsphere" {
   allow_unverified_ssl = true
 }
 ```
- When you deploy your own template and select **Import from a file**, a file cannot be selected using the Internet Explorer browser. Use a different browser to complete the task.

- When using the Internet Explorer browser, some user interface elements might be displayed differently even if the Cloud Automation Manager service works correctly.
