# Getting started with Cloud Automation Manager
<!-- Insert your short service name into topic title above -->
{: #CAMgettingstarted}
<!-- Provide an appropriate ID above -->

<!-- Short description: REQUIRED
The short description section should include one to two sentences describing why a developer would want to use your service in an app. This should be conversational style. For search engine optimization, include the service long name and "Bluemix". Keep the {: shortdesc} after the first paragraph so that the framework renders it properly.

Examples: -->


Use IBM Cloud Automation Manager in Bluemix to create and edit templates that implement common business patterns and to deploy them in your cloud environment. After they are deployed, you can manage and access the instances from the Cloud Automation Manager service.
{:shortdesc}

<!-- If overview content is required, do not include it here. Put it in a separate "## About" section below the task section. -->

<!-- Task section: REQUIRED
The task section includes steps to integrate the service into the app.  
- With task-based, technical information, reduce the conversational style in favor of succinct and direct instructions.
- DO include the basic, most-common-use scenario steps to use the service or integrate it into the app.
- DO NOT include steps to add the service from the Bluemix catalog; we assume that the user already took steps in the UI to add the service.
- DO include code snippets in all languages that can be copied, as well as VCAP service info.  
- For additional tasks like configuring, managing, etc., add a task section (## Gerund_task_title) below the task section or "About" section if used. Use a task title such as "Configuring x", "Administering y", "Managing z". -->

<!-- You can include an optional prerequisites paragraph for any prerequisites to be met before integrating the service. For example: -->

<!-- Include a sentence to briefly introduce the steps. Examples: -->

After you add the Cloud Automation Manager service from the Bluemix catalog, to get started with the service, create and deploy a template to your cloud provider. The following cloud providers are supported:
 - IBM Cloud
 - Amazon EC2
 - vSphere (Beta)

<!-- Note that before you can use the Cloud Automation Manager service to deploy templates to the IBM Cloud infrastructure (SoftLayer), you may need to upgrade and unify your Bluemix and SoftLayer accounts. For more information, see [Upgrading and unifying Bluemix and SoftLayer billing accounts](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/admin/softlayerlink.html){:new_window}. -->

Note that you can deploy templates to IBM Cloud infrastructures only within the region, organization, and space to which you are logged in.

Complete the following steps:

<!-- Use ordered list markup for the step section. For code examples:
- use three backticks ahead of and after the example (```)
- For copyable code snippet, multi-line, include {: codeblock} following the last set of backticks. A copy button will display in framework in output.
- For copyable command, single line, include {: pre} following the last set of backticks. When displayed, it will show "$" at the beginning of the command example and a copy button, but the copy button will include just the command example.
- For non-copyable output snippet, include {: screen} following the last set of backticks.

1. Click **Cloud Connections** to set a connection to the cloud provider where you want to deploy your template. For information about creating a connection, see [Managing connections](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/CloudAutomationManager/cam_managing_connections.html).
2. Click **Template Library** to create and deploy a template from scratch or deploy one of the pre-built templates. For information about deploying a template, see [Deploying a template](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/CloudAutomationManager/cam_deploying.html).
3. Click **Deployed Instances** to view the deployed instance details and perform actions on the related resources. For more information, see [Viewing instance details](https://console.{DomainName}/docs/services/CloudAutomationManager/cam_instance_details.html).

<!-- Related links section: REQUIRED.
Related links display in the upper right of the getting started page.
Ensure that you retain the lowercase anchor IDs (eg. {: #rellinks}) as shown in this template. These are used as IDs during transform and the doc framework keys off the IDs for display.
The headings coded here are not actually used. The doc framework provides the correct headings.
Also ensure that the related links stay in position at the end of this file or the doc framework will not display them properly.
