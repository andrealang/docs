#Compatible toolkit operators
{: #c_beta_adapters}

The {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} operators in the {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} Processing Language (SPL) standard toolkit should all be compatible with {{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsshort}}.

For more information about how to use operators such as FileSource and FileSink in the cloud environment, see [Getting your SPL application ready for the cloud](https://developer.ibm.com/streamsdev/docs/getting-spl-application-ready-cloud/){:new_window}.

If the operators that you need for your SPL applications are not included in this list, we would like to hear from you! Post your operator needs to the  [{{site.data.keyword.streaminganalyticsfull}} developers forum](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/streaming-analytics.html){:new_window}.
