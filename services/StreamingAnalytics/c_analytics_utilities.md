##Complex Event Processing Toolkit
{: #cep notoc}

The Complex Event Processing Toolkit (com.ibm.streams.cep) provides the MatchRegex operator to perform complex event processing.

For more information, see [Operator MatchRegex](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCRJU_4.2.0/com.ibm.streams.toolkits.doc/spldoc/dita/tk$com.ibm.streams.cep/op$com.ibm.streams.cep$MatchRegex.html?lang=en){:new_window} in the {{site.data.keyword.streamsshort}} product documentation.

##TimeSeries Toolkit
{: #timeseries notoc}

The operators and functions in the TimeSeries Toolkit (com.ibm.streams.timeseries) condition, analyze, and model time series data.

A time series is a sequence of numerical data that represent the value of an object or multiple objects over time. For example, you can have time series that contain: the monthly electricity usage that is collected from smart meters; daily stock prices and trading volumes; ECG recordings; seismographs; or network performance records. Time series have a temporal order and this temporal order is the foundation of all time series analysis algorithms.

The toolkit also provides a set of functions that you can see to generate time series for test and validation purposes.
