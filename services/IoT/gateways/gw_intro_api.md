# HTTP Messaging APIs for gateway devices (Beta)
{: #api}

**Important:** The {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} HTTP API for gateway devices feature is available only as part of a limited beta program. Future updates might include changes that are incompatible with the current version of this feature. Try it out and [let us know what you think ![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smart-spaces/17/internet-of-things.html){: new_window}.

## Accessing the HTTP Messaging API documentation for gateway devices
{: #rest_messaging_api}

To access the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} HTTP Messaging API documentation and find more information about sending events from gateway devices, see [{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} HTTP Messaging API ![External link icon](../../../icons/launch-glyph.svg)](https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/apis/swagger/v0002/http-messaging.html){: new_window}.


## Client connections
{: #client_connections}

For information about client security and how to connect clients to gateway devices in {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}, see [Connecting applications, devices, and gateways to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}](../reference/security/connect_devices_apps_gw.html).


## Publishing events
{: #event_publication}

In addition to using the MQTT messaging protocol, you can also configure your gateway devices to publish events to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} over HTTP by using HTTP Messaging API commands.

To submit a ``POST`` request from a device that is connected to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}, use one of the following URLs:

### Non-secure POST request
<pre class="pre"><code class="hljs">http://<var class="keyword varname">orgId</var>.messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com:1883/api/v0002/device/types/<var class="keyword varname">typeId</var>/devices/<var class="keyword varname">deviceId</var>/events/<var class="keyword varname">eventId</var></code></pre>

### Secure POST request
<pre class="pre"><code class="hljs">https://<var class="keyword varname">orgId</var>.messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com:8883/api/v0002/device/types/<var class="keyword varname">typeId</var>/devices/<var class="keyword varname">deviceId</var>/events/<var class="keyword varname">eventId</var></code></pre>

**Important notes:**
- You can submit gateway device events only by using HTTP messaging. Use the MQTT messaging protocol to submit requests for other gateway device management and control features.
- HTTP connections can be reused only to publish events for the same device because the authorization HTTP header cannot be changed.
- Port 443, the default SSL port, can also be specified for secure HTTP API calls.
- If a gateway is not assigned the *Standard Gateway* role, it can publish events on behalf of any devices in the organization. If the device that is connected to the gateway is unregistered, the gateway automatically registers that device.
- Assign the *Standard Gateway* role if you want to check device authorization levels.

For more information about the role of gateways and resource groups, see [Gateway Access Control (Beta)](../gateways/gateway-access-control.html).

### Authentication

All requests must include an authorization header. Basic authentication is the only method that is supported. When a device makes an HTTP request by using the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} HTTP REST API, the following credentials are required:

|Credential|Required input|
|:---|:---|
|User name| `g/{orgId}/{gwType}/{gwDevId}` or `g-{orgId}-{gwType}-{gwDevId}`
|Password| The authentication token that was either automatically generated or manually specified when you registered the gateway device.

Where:

<dl>
<dt>orgId</dt>  
<dd>The organization name, which must match the name that is specified in the host header.</dd>

<p></p>
<dt>gwType</dt>  
<dd>The type of gateway. </dd>
<dd>If you use the hyphen "-" character as a delimiter in the user name, this value must not include a hyphen character. </dd>
<p></p>
<dt>gwDevId</dt>  
<dd>The device identifier of gateway. </dd>
</dl>


### Content-Type request headers

A `Content-Type` request header must be provided with the request. The following table shows how the supported types are mapped to the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} internal formats:

|Content-Type header|Format in {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}|
|:---|:---|
|text/plain|"text"
|application/json| "json"
|application/xml | "xml"
|application/octet-stream|"bin"

### Quality of service

Similar to the MQTT quality of service "at most once" delivery service level 0, HTTP REST messaging provides non-persistent message delivery, but it validates that the request is correct and that it can be delivered to the server before it sends the HTTP response. A reply that contains an HTTP status code of 200 confirms that the message was delivered to the server. When you use either the "at most once" MQTT quality of service level or the HTTP equivalent to deliver event messages, the device or application must implement retry logic to guarantee delivery.

For more information about the MQTT protocol and the quality of service levels for {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}, see [MQTT messaging](../reference/mqtt/index.html).
