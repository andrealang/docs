# Developing {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} by using Node-RED
{: #dev_nodered}

Node-RED is a visual tool that you can use to develop your applications, devices, and gateways on {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}}. Node-RED provides capabilities for connecting hardware devices, APIs, and online services in new and interesting ways. Node-RED is built on top of Node.js and takes advantage of the huge node module ecosystem to provide a tool that can integrate many different systems.
{:shortdesc}

IBM provides Node-RED nodes to help you to connect your devices, gateways, and applications to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} and to create IoT solutions quickly.


## Watson IoT Node   
{: #watson_iot_node}  

![Watson IoT Node image](../images/node-red-watson.png "Watson IoT node image")


Watson IoT Node is a pair of nodes for connecting your devices or gateways to the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}. Devices or gateways can use these nodes to send events and to receive commands from the application.
