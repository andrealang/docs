{: #developer_doc_overview}

{: .last-updated}
Client libraries, content, and samples are available to help you to build and develop code to integrate your applications and devices on {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}}.
{:shortdesc}


## Developing your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}
{: #goals}
You can develop code to set up and connect your devices to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} and to retrieve and analyze the real-time data that you are interested in. Information is provided to help you to do the following common tasks:

-  Create and manage applications
-  Create, connect, and manage devices
-  Extend device management
-  Create and manage gateways
-  Retrieve device data


## Application development
{: #app-dev}

You can build and manage applications in {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} by using the following supported protocols and standards:

- MQTT messaging protocol
- Python
- Node.js
- Javaâ„¢
- C#

## Device development
{: #device-dev}

You can build and manage devices in {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} by using the following supported protocols and standards:

- MQTT messaging protocol
- Python
- Node.js
- Java
- C#
- Embedded C
- mBed C++

## Gateway development
{: #gateway-dev}
If your devices cannot directly connect to the internet, use the information provided to build a gateway device to retrieve and send data to applications in your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} organization.
The MQTT messaging protocol is supported for gateway development in {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}.
