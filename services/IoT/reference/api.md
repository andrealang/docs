# APIs
{: #api_overview}

Several APIs are available for developing code for devices, gateways, and applications that connect to {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}}.

The HTTP APIs are protected with HTTP basic authentication. When you generate an API key by using the dashboard, you are presented with a key and an authentication token. For more information about API keys and tokens, see [API key connection](../platform_authorization.html#api-key).


## About HTTP APIs
{: #api_about}

After registering for your own organization, you are provided with a 6 character organization ID which is required in the hostname for any HTTP API calls. The base URL for your organization can be accessed at the following address:

https://<**orgId**>.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/api/v0002

To authenticate requests to the application API, set the username to the API key and the password to the authentication token.

For Messaging APIs, use the following address:

https://<**orgId**>.messaging.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/api/v0002
