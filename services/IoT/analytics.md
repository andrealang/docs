# Real-Time IoT Data Analytics
{: #analytics}  

Use Watson {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} analytics to get the real-time analytical information that you need from the raw data that your devices produce.  
{: shortdesc}

By using [boards and cards](data_visualization.html), you can view graphics that represent data set values from one or more devices for a quick overview and understanding of the device data.

With analytics rules, you specify the conditions that trigger actions. For example, you might create a rule to ensure that an alert is sent to the dashboard on a user's device, and that an email is sent to the administrator, when the device is dropped, or when the temperature of the device spikes.

Use [cloud rules](cloud_analytics.html) to trigger rules for devices that are connected directly to {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} in the cloud, and [edge rules](edge_analytics.html) to trigger rules for devices that are connected to edge analytics enabled gateways.
