# Managing user roles

User roles dictate which operations that user is permitted to perform. You can change the assigned role of a user by using the {{site.data.keyword.iot_full}} dashboard or by using the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} API.

## Changing a user role by using the dashboard

1. From your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard, select **Access** > **Members** in the left navigation bar.
2. Click the **Edit** icon next to the user that you would like to update.
3. Select a role and then click **Done**.

<!--
## Changing a user role by using the API

For information on using the API to change a user role, see the [{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} API documentation](https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/swagger/v0002.html).
