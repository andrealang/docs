1. Enable push on your mobile application
1. Send a Push Notification

You can use the service to send broadcasts, unicasts (based on deviceID and userID), tag-based notification, webhooks event-based notification, as well as Rich Media notifications and interactive notifications to your mobile and web browser application users. The service also provides you with monitoring capabilities that helps you monitor Push Notification performance by generating graphs and reports from your user data. See [Monitoring for Push Notifications](/docs/services/mobilepush/t_push_monitoring.html).
