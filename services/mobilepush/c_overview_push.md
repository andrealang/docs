# Push Notification service
{: #overview-push}
Last updated: 31 March 2017
{: .last-updated}

IBM {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} is a service with which you can use to send notifications to devices and platforms. Notifications can be targeted to all application users or to a specific set of users and devices using tags. You can administer devices, tags, and subscriptions.  

You can use any of the following options to create a bound or unbound service:

- By creating a Bluemix application using the MobileFirst Services Starter boilerplate from the catalog. This creates a Push Notifications service bound to a Bluemix back-end application.
- By creating an unbound Push Notifications service directly from the Mobile catalog. You can later bind to an application or even choose to use it unbound. 
- By using the [Mobile dashboard ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/mobile/services.html){: new_window}.

Note that the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} monitoring tab does not show analytics data.

The {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service is now OpenWhisk enabled. For more information, see [OpenWhisk](/docs/openwhisk/index.html).


## Push Notification service process
{: #overview_push_process}

Mobile, Web browser clients and Google Chrome Apps and Extensions can subscribe and register for the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service. On startup, the client applications will register and subscribe themselves to the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service. The notifications are dispatched to the Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)/Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) server and then sent to registered mobile or browser clients.

### Mobile and browser applications
{: #mobile-applications}

On start-up, client applications register and subscribe themselves to the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service to receive notifications.

### Back end applications
{: #backend-applications}

Back end applications can be either on premise, or in a public cloud. Back end applications will use the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service to send context-sensitive notifications to mobile and browser application users. The back end applications are not required to maintain and manage mobile devices, browser agents and user information for sending push notifications. Instead, back end applications can use the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service which will manage and maintain them.

### App backend owner
{: #app-backend-owner}

The App backend owner creates the mobile back end application which bundles an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service. The App back end owner also configures and sets up the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service to suit the back end applications using the service along with mobile  and browser applications that are target for {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}}.

### Push Notification service
{: #push-notification-service}

The {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service manages all information related to mobile devices and web browser clients that are registered for notifications. The service keeps your applications transparent to the technology details of sending notifications to heterogeneous mobile and web browser platforms, handling all of this within.

### Gateways
{: #gateways}

Platform specific Push Notifications cloud services such as FCM/GCM or Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) that is used by IBM {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service to dispatch notifications to the mobile and browser applications.

### Push security
{: #push-security}

{{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} APIs are secured by two types of secrets:

- **appSecret**: The `appSecret` protects APIs that are typically invoked by back end applications - such as the API to send {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} and the API to configure settings.
- **clientSecret**:  The `clientSecret` protects APIs that are typically invoked by mobile client applications. There is only one API related to registration of a device with an associated UserId that requires this `clientSecret`. None of the other APIs invoked from mobile clients require the `clientSecret`. 

The `appSecret` and `clientSecret` are allocated to every service instance at the time of binding an application with {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service. Refer to the [REST APIs ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://mobile.{DomainName}/imfpush/) documentation for information on how the secrets are to be passed and for what APIs.

**Note**: Earlier applications were required to pass the clientSecret only when registering or updating devices with userId field. All other APIs invoked by mobile and browser clients did not require clientSecret. These old applications can continue to use the clientSecret optionally for device registrations or updating calls. However, it is strongly recommended that clientSecret check is enforced for all client API calls. To enforce this in existing applications, there is a new `verifyClientSecret` API that is published.  For new applications, clientSecret check will be enforced on all client API calls and this behavior cannot be changed with the `verfiyClientSecret` API.

By default, client secret verification is enforced only in new apps. Both existing and new apps are allowed to enable or disable the client secret verification using the verifyClientSecret REST API. It is recommended that you enforce client secret verification to avoid exposing devices to users who might know the applicationId and deviceId.

Ensure that the `clientSecret` is kept confidential and never hard-coded into the mobile app. There are various application initialization patterns that can be used to pull in the `clientSecret` dynamically during the applications runtime. The sequence diagram outlines on such possible pattern.

## Push Notification types
{: #overview-push-types}

### Broadcast
{: #broadcast}

When a client application registers itself with {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service, it can start to receive broadcasts. Broadcast notifications are messages targeted to all instances of an application installed across mobile devices, browsers or implemented as Chrome apps or extension instances and configured for the {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service. Broadcast notifications are enabled by default for any application enabled for {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}}. Applications enabled for {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} service has a predefined subscription to the Push.ALL tag, which is used by server to broadcast notification messages to all devices. To send a broadcast notification that uses the REST Push API, ensure that the "target" is an empty JSON file when posting to the messages resource.

### Tag-based notifications
{: #tag-based-notifications}

Tag notifications are messages targeted to all devices that are subscribed to a particular tag. Tags-based notifications allow segmentation of notifications based on subject areas or topics. Notification recipients can choose to receive notifications only if it is about a subject or topic that is of interest. Therefore, tags-based notification provides a means to segment recipients. This feature enables the ability to define tags and then send and receive messages by tags. A message is targeted to only the client application instances (on mobile, browser or as an app or extensions) that are subscribed to the tag. You must first create tags for the application, set up the tag subscriptions and then initiate the tag-based notifications. To send a tag-based notification that uses the REST API, ensure that the "tagNames" are provided when posting to the message resource.

### Unicast notifications
{: #unicast-notifications}

Unicast notifications are messages targeted to a particular device or user. Unicast notifications targeted to devices do not require any additional setup and are enabled by default when the application is enabled for {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}}.

However, Unicast notifications targeted at users require associating a user ID with a device at the time of registering the client mobile device or web browser or Chrome Apps and Extensions for {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}}.   

Typically, a client application will first run an authentication cycle where the mobile app user is authenticated against a authentication service like [Mobile Client Access](docs/services/mobileaccess/index.html). On successful authentication, the authenticated user ID is then passed into the Push Device Registration API. 
To send a Unicast notifications through REST API, ensure that the deviceIds or userIds are provided when posting to a message resource.

### Platform-based notifications
{: #platform-based-notifications}

Notifications can be targeted to reach a particular device platform. For example, a notification can be sent to all Android users or Google Chrome users only. To send a platform-based notification that uses the REST API, make sure that the targeted platforms are provided when posting to a message resource. Specify the platforms as an array. The supported platforms are as follows:
* A (Apple)
* G (Google)
* WEB_CHROME (Google Chrome Browser Web Push)
* WEB_FIREFOX (Mozilla Firefox Browser Web Push)
* WEB_SAFARI (Safari Browser Web Push)
* APPEXT_CHROME (Google Chrome Apps & Extensions)

## Push Notification message size
{: #push-message-size}

The {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} message payload size is dependent on the constraints laid out by the Gateways (FCM/GCM, APNs) and client platforms. 

### iOS and Safari
{: #ios-message-size}

For iOS 8 and later, the maximum size allowed is 2 kilobytes. Apple Push Notification service does not send notifications that exceeds this limit.

### Android, Firefox browser, Chrome browser, and Chrome Apps & Extensions
{: #android-message-size}

There is a limitation of 4 kilobytes as the maximum allowed message payload size.
