After you have developed your applications, you can send basic push notifications (without using tags, badges, additional payloads, or sound files).

To send basic push notifications, complete the listed steps:

1. Select **Send Notifications**, and then choose the appropriate **Send to** option. 

**Note**: When you select the **All Devices** option, all devices subscribed to {{site.data.keyword.mobilepushshort}} will receive notifications.
