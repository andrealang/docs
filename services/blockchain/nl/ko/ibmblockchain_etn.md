# HSBN 및 스타터 플랜
{: #ibmblockchain_etn}


IBM Blockchain on Bluemix 스타터 개발자 및 HSBN(High Security Business Network) 플랜은 Hyperledger Fabric v0.6 기반입니다. 각 인스턴스는 4노드 네트워크로서 실행되며, 인증 기관은 ID 및 멤버 권한을 관리합니다. HSBN이 IBM Secure Service Container 내의 분리된 단일 테넌트로 실행되는 반면 스타터 개발자 네트워크는 {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}}의 공유 멀티 테넌트 환경에서 실행됩니다.

<!---The High-Security business network provides important capabilities above and beyond the two-node multi-tenant developer service on Softlayer (aimed towards application development; writing chaincode and experimenting with APIs).  The high security plan supplies your own private blockchain test environment, which has been vetted and secured by IBM.  With the following features, your dedicated and high security environment enables you to take the next step towards preparing your organization for enterprise blockchain networks:~~

~~1. A dedicated four-node blockchain network; single-tenant with no shared resources~~
~~2. An IBM-certified version of the latest Hyperledger fabric, along with mechanisms to unlock inherent identity and security features~~
~~3. Isolation and protection from system and platform administrators, root users, and unauthorized users.~~
~~4. Verified test cases for security, consensus, availability, and performance--->
