# HSBN 和入门模板套餐
{: #ibmblockchain_etn}


IBM Blockchain on Bluemix“入门模板开发者”和“高安全性业务网络”(HSBN) 套餐以 Hyperledger Fabric V0.6 为基础构建。每个实例都作为四节点网络运行，并由认证中心来管理身份和成员许可权。“入门模板开发者”网络在 {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} 上的共享多租户环境中运行，而 HSBN 则作为 IBM Secure Service Container 中的隔离单租户运行。

<!---The High-Security business network provides important capabilities above and beyond the two-node multi-tenant developer service on Softlayer (aimed towards application development; writing chaincode and experimenting with APIs).  The high security plan supplies your own private blockchain test environment, which has been vetted and secured by IBM.  With the following features, your dedicated and high security environment enables you to take the next step towards preparing your organization for enterprise blockchain networks:~~

~~1. A dedicated four-node blockchain network; single-tenant with no shared resources~~
~~2. An IBM-certified version of the latest Hyperledger fabric, along with mechanisms to unlock inherent identity and security features~~
~~3. Isolation and protection from system and platform administrators, root users, and unauthorized users.~~
~~4. Verified test cases for security, consensus, availability, and performance--->
