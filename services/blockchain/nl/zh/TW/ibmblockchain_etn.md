# HSBN 及入門範本方案
{: #ibmblockchain_etn}


IBM Blockchain on Bluemix 的「入門範本開發人員」及「高安全性商業網路 (HSBN)」方案是以 Hyperledger Fabric 0.6 版為建置基礎。每個實例會執行為四節點的網路，並有憑證管理中心負責管理身分和成員許可權。「入門範本開發人員」網路在 {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer}} 上的共用多方承租戶環境中執行，HSBN 則是作為 IBM Secure Service Container 內的隔離單一承租戶來執行。

<!---The High-Security business network provides important capabilities above and beyond the two-node multi-tenant developer service on Softlayer (aimed towards application development; writing chaincode and experimenting with APIs).  The high security plan supplies your own private blockchain test environment, which has been vetted and secured by IBM.  With the following features, your dedicated and high security environment enables you to take the next step towards preparing your organization for enterprise blockchain networks:~~

~~1. A dedicated four-node blockchain network; single-tenant with no shared resources~~
~~2. An IBM-certified version of the latest Hyperledger fabric, along with mechanisms to unlock inherent identity and security features~~
~~3. Isolation and protection from system and platform administrators, root users, and unauthorized users.~~
~~4. Verified test cases for security, consensus, availability, and performance--->
