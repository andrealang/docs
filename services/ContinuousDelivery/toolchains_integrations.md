### Configuring an Artifactory npm build job in your pipeline
{: #config_artifactory_npm}

Before you configure an npm build job in your pipeline, you must have a working pipeline that can use your build SCM repo as input and you must configure Artifactory for your toolchain. For instructions to configure Artifactory, see the [Artifactory](#artifactory) section.

Configure {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} to add an npm build job:

1. Create a stage and set the input to the appropriate SCM repo.
1. On the stage, add a build job.
1. Configure the build job:
  ![npm build job](images/artifactory_npm_job.png)

  a. For the builder type, select **NPM Build**.

  b. If you configured multiple instances of the Artifactory tool integration, enter the name of the Artifactory tool integration that you want to configure the npm build job for.

  c. For the tool integration type, select **Artifactory**.

  d. For the build command, enter the commands to build your npm module or publish it to your registry. This example shows the commands to either build the module or publish it.
     ```
     npm install
     # or
     npm publish --registry "${NPM_RELEASE_URL}"
     ```
  **Tip**: You can find the URL and user credentials that you used to connect to your registry in the configuration settings for the Artifactory tool integration.

  e. If your build job publishes to the Artifactory registry and the format of your node module version is `x.y.z-SNAPSHOT.w`, select the **Increment snapshot module version** check box. The build job automatically updates the module version before the job publishes to the Artifactory registry. The job selects the highest version of the module from the npm registry and the local `package.json` file, and increments the module version by using semver. The build job does not deliver the changes to the SCM repo.

1. Click **SAVE**. Whenever your pipeline runs, this build job uses the configuration information from the Artifactory tool integration to connect to your npm registry.

### Configuring an Artifactory Maven build job in your pipeline
{: #config_artifactory_maven}

Before you configure a Maven Build job in your pipeline, you need a working pipeline that can use your build SCM repo as input, and you must configure Artifactory for your toolchain. For instructions to configure Artifactory, see the [Artifactory](#artifactory) section.

Configure the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} to add a Maven Build job:

1. Create a stage and set the input to the appropriate SCM repo.
1. On the stage, add a build job.
1. Configure the build job:

### Configuring a Sauce Labs test job in your pipeline
{: #config_saucelabs}

Before you configure a Sauce Labs test job in your pipeline, you need a working pipeline that has stages to build and deploy your app, and you must configure Sauce Labs for your toolchain. For instructions to configure Sauce Labs, see the [Sauce Labs](#saucelabs) section.

Configure the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} to add a Sauce Labs test job:

1. If you don't have a stage that deploys a test version of your app, create one.
1. On the stage, add a test job after the deploy job. By placing these jobs in the same stage, they can access the same set of environment properties.   
  ![Test job](images/toolchain_test_job.png)

1. Configure the stage:

  a. On the **ENVIRONMENT PROPERTIES** tab, create three properties: CF_APP_NAME, SAUCE_USERNAME, and SAUCE_ACCESS_KEY.

  b. Enter your Sauce Labs user name and access key. By doing so, you externalize those values so that you can use them in your tests.

1. Configure the deploy job. In the **Deploy Script** field, include this command: `export CF_APP_NAME="$CF_APP"`. That command exports the app name as an environment property.
1. Configure the test job. The values in the following image are examples. The **Service Instance**, **Target**, **Organization**, and **Space** fields are populated with the Sauce Labs user name, region, org, and space that you are using.  
![Configure job](images/toolchain_configure_job.png)

  a. For the tester type, select **Sauce Labs**.

 **Note:** These instructions apply to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated for {{site.data.keyword.ghe_short}}. If you are using your own managed version of {{site.data.keyword.ghe_short}}, some steps might differ depending on your internal procedures.

{{site.data.keyword.ghe_long}} is an on-premises, web-based hosting service for Git repos. Dedicated {{site.data.keyword.ghe_short}} is for {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated customers only. GitHub Issues is a tracking tool that keeps your work and your plans in one place. It is integrated with your development repo so that you can focus on important tasks. For more information about Dedicated {{site.data.keyword.ghe_short}} and GitHub Issues, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.ghe_long}}](/docs/services/ghededicated/index.html){: new_window} and [GitHub Issues ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/devops/method/content/think/tool_github_issues/){: new_window}.

You can configure {{site.data.keyword.ghe_short}} as a tool integration in your toolchain so that you can manage source code in your company's [{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated](/docs/dedicated/index.html#dedicated){: new_window} instance.

1. If you are configuring this tool integration as you are creating the toolchain, follow these steps:

 a. Before you log in to Dedicated {{site.data.keyword.ghe_short}} for the first time, ask your company's region administrator to add your user ID to your {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated instance from your company's user registry by using LDAP. For information about setting up your {{site.data.keyword.ghe_short}} account, see [Getting started with {{site.data.keyword.ghe_long}}](/docs/services/ghededicated/index.html){: new_window}.

 b. In the Configurable Integrations section, click **{{site.data.keyword.ghe_short}}**.    

 c. Review the default name for the new {{site.data.keyword.ghe_short}} repo. If needed, change the name of the new repo. The following image shows an example of a repo that is cloned from a sample repo. You can use an existing repo or a new repo. To use a new repo, you can create an empty repo, clone a repo, or fork a repo.
