# About Continuous Delivery  
{: #cd_about}  

With {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}}, you can build, test, and deliver applications by using DevOps practices and industry-leading tools.
{:shortdesc}

The {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service supports your DevOps workflows:

 * You can create integrated DevOps open [toolchains](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/toolchains_about.html){: new_window} to enable tool integrations that support your development, deployment, and operations tasks.

  A toolchain is an integrated set of tools that you can use to collaboratively develop, build, deploy, test, and manage applications. You can create toolchains that include {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} services, open source tools, and third-party tools, such as GitHub, PagerDuty, and Slack, that make development and operations repeatable and easier to manage.

 * Deliver continuously by using automated [pipelines](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_about.html){: new_window}.

  Automate builds, unit tests, deployments, and more. Build, test, and deploy in a repeatable way with minimal human intervention. Be ready to release into production at any time.

 * Edit and push your code from anywhere by using the [web-based IDE](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/web_ide.html){: new_window}.

  Create, edit, run, and debug, and complete source-control tasks in GitHub. Seemlessly move from editing your code to deploying it to production.

 * Improve quality through [{{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/di_working.html){: new_window}.

  Understand the dynamics of your team as it develops and delivers code. Learn how users interact with your application. Review data to help you manage your application's operations.


## Toolchain availability on Bluemix Public compared to Bluemix Dedicated
{: #public_and_dedicated}

{{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public is an open-standards, cloud-based platform where you can build, run, and manage applications that are accessed by [http://bluemix.net ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://bluemix.net){:new_window}. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated provides the capabilities of {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} in a dedicated SoftLayer environment that is securely connected to both the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public environment and your network. Your company's {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated environment might not contain the same tool integrations as the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public site.

For source-code management and issue tracking, {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public generally uses github.com. {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated can also use github.com, but it generally uses {{site.data.keyword.ghe_short}} that is either installed by your company or managed by IBM.

{{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} is available on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated. Toolchains differ depending on whether you use {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public or {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated.

## Toolchain templates
{: #templates}

You can use a template as a starting point to [create a toolchain ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/create){: new_window}. Toolchain templates include specific sets of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks.

**Tip**: Your company's {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated environment might not contain the same toolchain templates as the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public site. Toolchain templates that are available on both {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Public and {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated might contain a different set of tool integrations on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Dedicated.

Some toolchain templates include tool integrations that are part of the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service. If an instance of that service isn't already in your organization, when you click **Create** to create the toolchain, the service is automatically added at no cost to you. For more information and terms, see the [Bluemix catalog ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/){:new_window}.

The microservices toolchain templates deploy an app with Catalog and Orders APIs that are backed by a Cloudant store. As part of deploying the app, a no-cost Cloudant service instance is created. For more information and terms, see the [Bluemix catalog ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db/){:new_window}.
