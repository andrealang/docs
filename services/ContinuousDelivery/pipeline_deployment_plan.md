# Customizing deployment plans for composite pipelines
{: #tasks_overview}

In a deployment plan for a composite pipeline, a task represents some business-meaningful activity that is associated with a software deployment. Tasks are defined in deployment plans.

{:shortdesc}

Most tasks have a starting point, an ending point, and a measurable duration. A task can be of one of following types:

<ul>
<li>Manual tasks can represent any activity that is associated with a software deployment, such as taking a server offline or updating a database.</li>
<li>UrbanCode Deploy tasks represent IBM&reg; UrbanCode&reg; Deploy apps. You can run IBM UrbanCode Deploy apps with IBM UrbanCode Deploy-type tasks.</li>
<li>Continuous Delivery Pipeline tasks represent instances of {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}}, which is part of {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}}. You can manage your instances of {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} with this task type.</li>
<li>Delayed tasks represent critical events that happen at a specific time.</li>
<li>Header tasks are organizational elements. For example, you might use a header task to identify a task group.</li>
</ul>

<!-- You can add tasks to deployment plans by creating tasks or you can import tasks from CSV files that are created by IBM UrbanCode Release or another application. You can also copy tasks from other deployment plans. See [Importing tasks](/docs/services/UCCR/UCCR_deployPlan.html#plan_importTasks) for information about the format of the CSV file. -->

# Creating tasks
{: #tasks_create}

When you create a task, you select the deployment plan where you want to add the task. By default, new tasks are inserted at the end of the deployment plan. After a task is created, you can move it or copy it and paste it into another deployment plan. You can also create dependencies with other [tasks](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery/pipeline_deployment_plan.html#tasks_dependencies).

After you save a task, action icons are displayed for the task. You can use the action icons to change the task's status during a deployment. All tasks have the **Skip** action icon. Other icons, such as **Start**, are displayed when the context is appropriate for them.

![](../UCCR/images/deploy-plan-intro.png "Typical deployment plan")

*Figure 1. A simple deployment plan with tasks and action icons*

Each task in a deployment plan is contained in a separate row. The information that is displayed for each task is described in the following table.

### Table 1. Task properties

| Property  | Description  |
| ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Name               |Task name       |
| Type               |Type of task: Manual, Continuous Delivery Pipeline, Delayed, Email, Header / Note, UrbanCode Deploy|             
| Status             |Task status: Not started, complete, failed, skipped, not applicable |
| Owner              |Person to whom the task is assigned                                                        |
| Start Time  |Start time or expected start time based on scheduled start, or estimated duration of other tasks        |
| End Time               |Time that the task was resolved        |
| Duration               |Length of time from task start to task resolution (in minutes)        |
| Dependencies               |Number of tasks that are prerequisites for the task and dependent on the task        |

After tasks are added to deployment plans, you can manage them in several ways:

   * To move a task, drag it to a new location.

   * To copy a task or group, click the task, click the **Copy** icon <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/copy-group.png"  alt="copy icon">, place the cursor where you want to insert the copied task, and click the **Paste** icon <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/paste-group.png"  alt="paste icon">.

   * To cut a task or group from a deployment plan, click the task and click **Cut** <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/cut-group.png"  alt="cut icon">.

   * To delete a task, click it and click **Delete** <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/trash-group.png"  alt="delete icon">. The task is removed from the deployment plan.

<!-- ## Creating UrbanCode Deploy tasks
{: #tasks_UDTasks}

UrbanCode Deploy tasks manage UrbanCode Deploy applications. When you run an UrbanCode Deploy task, the associated UrbanCode Deploy application runs by using the process, version, and environment specified by the task. You can set the version and environment at design time or wait and select them at run time.

During deployments, UrbanCode Deploy tasks start automatically when they become eligible to run.   

**Important** Applications become available after {{site.data.keyword.uccr_short}} is integrated with UrbanCode Deploy. The applications that are available to a deployment plan depend on the team that is assigned to the plan. The applications that are managed by the team in UrbanCode Deploy are also available in {{site.data.keyword.uccr_short}}.

Complete the following tasks to create an UrbanCode Deploy task.

1. On the Deployment Plan Details page, click **Create Task**. If you want to insert a task at a specific position in the plan, select a task before using the **Create Task**. The new task is inserted above the selected task.

1. On the Create Task dialog box, in the **Type** list, select **UrbanCode Deploy**.

1. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the task.

3. In the **Duration (minutes)** field, enter the number of minutes that you expect the task to run until it is completed. The estimated duration is used to calculate expected deployment times.

3. In the **Tags** list, attach a tag to the task. You can select multiple tags. To create a tag, type the tag name in list's text field.

3. In the **Application Name** list, select an application.

3. In the **Process** list, select an application process. Processes that belong to the selected UrbanCode Deploy application are available.

3. In the **Environment** list, select an application environment. Environments that belong to the selected UrbanCode Deploy application are available.  To postpone selecting an environment until you are ready to run the deployment, select **Use Version Tab**.

3. In the **Version** list, select an application version. Versions refer to IBM UrbanCode Deploy application snapshots. Versions that belong to the selected application are available.  To postpone selecting a version, select **Use Version Tab**. If the application process does not require a version, select **No Version**. You might select this last option if you are running a configuration-type process that does not require components.

3. In the **Assigned groups and users** list, assign the task to a user or group. The assigned user runs the task during deployment.

3. In the **Owner** list, select the task owner. The default owner is the user who created the task. The **Owner** list is displayed after the task is assigned to a user or group.    

5. Click **Save**. The task is inserted into the deployment plan.

After the task is created, the plan's **Version** tab is updated with information about the application assigned to the task. If you selected **Use Version Tab** for the application environment and version, use the Version tab to set those options before running the deployment. -->

## Creating manual tasks
{: #tasks_manual}

Typically, manual tasks represent some activity that is associated with a software release that has a start point, an end point, and a measurable duration.

To create a manual task, follow these steps:

1. On the Deployment Plan Details page, click **Create Task**. To insert a task at a specific position in the plan, before you click **Create Task**, select a task. The new task is inserted above the selected task.

1. In the Create Task window, from the **Type** list, select **Manual**.

1. In the **Name** field, type a name for the task.

3. In the **Duration (minutes)** field, type the number of minutes that you expect the task to run until it is completed. The estimated duration is used to calculate expected deployment times.

3. In the **Tags** list, attach a tag to the task. You can select multiple tags. To create a tag, type the tag name in list's text field.

3. In the **Assigned groups and users** list, assign the task to a user or group. The assigned user runs the task during deployment.

3. From the **Owner** list, select the task owner. The default owner is the user who created the task. The **Owner** list is displayed after the task is assigned to a user or group.    

5. Click **Save**. The task is inserted into the deployment plan.

## Creating delayed tasks
{: #tasks_delayed}

Delayed-type tasks represent milestones or critical events during a deployment. With delayed tasks, you can ensure that important tasks start at the expected time. Typically, delayed tasks are prerequisites for other important tasks.

A delayed task starts as soon as it is eligible to run, and it finishes at a user-specified time. A started delayed-type task has a status of "In Progress" until it reaches its planned-for time, when its status is changed to "Complete". When a delayed task is completed, tasks that depend on it start to run.

To create a delayed task, follow these steps:

1. On the Deployment Plan Details page, click **Create Task**. If you want to insert a task at a specific position in the plan, before you click **Create Task**, select a task. The new task is inserted above the selected task.

1. In the Create Task window, from the **Type** list, select **Delayed**.

1. In the **Name** field, type a name for the task.

3. In the **Time** field, enter or select the time that the task will be completed.

3. In the **Time Zone** list, select the time zone for the value that is entered in the **Time** field.    

5. Click **Save**. The task is inserted into the deployment plan.

## Creating header tasks
{: #tasks_header}

Header tasks represent organization elements that you can add to deployment plans. If you create a task group, you might identify the group with a header task. Header tasks can have dependencies like any other task.

<!-- When you import a deployment plan from IBM UrbanCode Release, segment tasks are bracketed by note-type Start Segment and End Segment tasks. Segment dependencies are represented by dependencies to End Segment tasks. -->

To create a header task, follow these steps:

1. On the Deployment Plan Details page, click **Create Task**. If you want to insert a task at a specific position in the plan, before you click **Create Task**, select a task. The new task is inserted above the selected task.

1. In the Create Task window, from the **Type** list, select **Header**.

1. In the **Name** field, type a name for the task. The name might represent a task group name.

3. In the **Description** field, type or paste a description. You might enter a note, a reminder, or other instructions.

5. Click **Save**. The task is inserted into the deployment plan.

## Creating Delivery Pipeline tasks
{: #tasks_pipelineCD}

In the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service, {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} automates your DevOps workflows. You can manage your instances of {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} with pipeline tasks.

To create a Delivery Pipeline task, follow these steps:

1. On the Deployment Plan Details page, click **Create Task**. If you want to insert a task at a specific position in the plan, before you click **Create Task**, select a task. The new task is inserted above the selected task.

1. In the Create Task window, from the **Type** list, select **Continuous Delivery Pipeline**.

1. In the **Name** field, type a name for the task. The name might represent a task group name.

3. In the **Description** field, type or paste a description. You might enter a note, a reminder, or other instructions.

3. In the **Pipeline ID** field, type or paste the pipeline ID.

3. In the **Stage Name** field, type or paste the stage name.

5. Click **Save**. The task is inserted into the deployment plan.

## Managing task groups
{: #tasks_groups}

You can combine two or more tasks into a task group. When you create a group, you define the group's execution pattern, which is sequential or parallel. You can run the tasks in a parallel-pattern group in any order and can run tasks simultaneously unless dependencies exist. The tasks in sequential groups are done in list-order, starting with the first or top-most task.

You can embed groups within other groups. You can embed a sequential-pattern group within a parallel-pattern group, and vice versa. However, you cannot embed a sequential-pattern group within another sequential group or embed a parallel-pattern group within another parallel group.  

To create a task group, follow these steps:

1. On the Deployment Plan Detail page, select two or more tasks.

1. Depending on the type of group you want to create, complete one of these steps:

  <ul>
  <li>To create a parallel group, click the **Parallel** icon <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/para-icon.png"  alt="parallel group icon">. If you cannot create a parallel group with the selected tasks, the icon is disabled. For example, you might not be able to create a parallel group if all of the selected tasks are already in a parallel group.
  </li>
  <li>To create a sequential group, click the **Sequential** icon <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/seq-icon.png"  alt="sequential group icon">.
  </li>
  </ul>

The group is formed and a group select bar is added to the deployment plan. If you selected discontiguous tasks, the tasks form a contiguous list that starts with the top-most selected task.

The following figure shows a parallel group. The group select bar identifies the type of group: parallel <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/para-select.png"  alt="parallel group select"> or sequential <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/seq-select.png"  alt="sequential group select">.

(![](../UCCR/images/group-select.png "Typical deployment plan"))

*Figure 2. A parallel group*

To move a group, click the **group select bar** or click anywhere in the group and drag it to a new location.

To copy a group, select the group, click the **Copy** icon <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/copy-group.png"  alt="copy icon">, place the cursor where you want to insert the copied group, and click **Paste** <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/paste-group.png"  alt="paste icon">.

To cut a group, select the group and click the **Cut** icon <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/cut-group.png"  alt="cut icon">.

To ungroup a group, select the group and click the **Ungroup** icon <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/ungroup-icon.png"  alt="ungroup icon"> on the group select bar.

To delete the tasks that are in a group, select the group and click the **Delete** icon <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/trash-group.png"  alt="delete icon">. The tasks are removed from the deployment plan.

## Managing task tags
{: #tasks_tags}

Tags are organizing elements that you can add to tasks. You can filter deployment plans by tag. For example, during a deployment to a production environment, you might disable tasks that include the `DEV_only` tag, which indicates that the tasks are for the development environment only.

To add a tag to a task, follow these steps:

1. On the Deployment Plan Details page, select a task or task group and click **Manage Tags**  <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/task-tag.png"  alt="manage tags">. You can select multiple tasks and groups.

1. In the "Manage Tags for Selected Tasks" window, from the **Common Tags** list, select tags. You can create a tag by typing a name in the list's text box.

1. Click **Save**.

Tags are displayed in the task rows of the Deployment Plan Details page. In the following figure, the Deploy WAR task has two tags: `Deployment` and `Critical`.

The tags that are used by a deployment plan are displayed on the **Versions** tab of the Deployment Plan Details page. To render a task to be not applicable for a deployment, clear the task's tags. Tasks with the "Not Applicable" status cannot be started.  

![](../UCCR/images/task-tag-labels.png "Typical deployment plan")

*Figure 3. Task tags*

## Creating task dependencies
{: #tasks_dependencies}

You can make a task a prerequisite for other tasks. If a task is a prerequisite, dependent tasks cannot start, even if they are otherwise eligible, until the prerequisite task is resolved.

A task can have multiple dependent tasks and multiple prerequisite tasks. You can define dependencies for a task with any other task in the deployment plan. However, you cannot create circular dependencies. For example, you cannot make a task dependent on a task that itself depends on the first task.

By controlling task dependencies, you can ensure that events occur in their expected order.

To make a task a prerequisite for other tasks, complete these steps:

1. On the Deployment Plan Details page, select a task or task group and click **Manage Prerequisites** <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/task-depend.png"  alt="task prerequisite">. You can select multiple tasks and groups.

1. In the "Manage Prerequisites for Selected Tasks" window, from the **Prerequisite tasks for selected tasks** list, select the prerequisite task.

1. Click **Save**.

Task dependencies are shown in the Dependencies column on the Deployment Plan Detail page. Up arrows indicate task prerequisites; down arrows indicate task dependencies.

In the following figure, the first task does not have any prerequisites and two tasks depend on it. The second task has one prerequisite task and no tasks depend on it.

(![](../UCCR/images/plan-w-depend.png "Typical deployment plan"))

*Figure 4. Task dependencies*

To review or modify dependencies, select the task and click **Manage Prerequisites** <img class="inline" src="../UCCR/images/task-depend.png"  alt="task prerequisite">.
