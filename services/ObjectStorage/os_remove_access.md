# Removing access

You can remove access to a container or object by using access control lists.
{: shortdesc}

To remove read ACLs from a container, run one of the following commands.

* Swift command:

```
swift post <container_name> --read-acl “”
```
{: pre}

* cURL command:

```
curl -i <OS_STORAGE_URL> -X POST -H "Content-Length: 0" -H "X-Container-Read: " -H "X-Auth-Token: <OS_AUTH_TOKEN>"
```
{: pre}

To remove write ACLs from a container, run one of the following commands.

* Swift command:

```
swift post <container_name> --write-acl “”
```
{: pre}

* cURL command:

```
curl -i <OS_STORAGE_URL> -X POST -H "Content-Length: 0" -H "X-Container-Write: " -H "X-Auth-Token: <OS_AUTH_TOKEN>"
```
{: pre}

To verify that you have removed an ACL run one of the following commands.

* Swift command:

```
swift stat <container_name>
```
{: pre}

* The following example output shows both the Read ACL and Write ACL as blank, which means that access has been removed.
