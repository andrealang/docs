# Bluemix Public {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}}

Public {{site.data.keyword.objectstorageshort}}, based on  Swift, provides a fully provisioned, API accessible storage platform to manage your data. You can use it directly in your applications or for backups, making it ideal for cost effective, scale-out storage.
{: shortdesc}

To get started with Object Storage, complete the following tasks:

1. Authenticate your service instance with [Keystone](/docs/services/ObjectStorage/os_authenticate.html).
2. Generate [credentials](/docs/services/ObjectStorage/os_credentials.html) for your service.
3. Configure the [Swift client](/docs/services/ObjectStorage/os_configuring.html) and other prerequisite software.
4. Construct either a [temporary](/docs/services/ObjectStorage/os_tempurl.html) or [permanent](/docs/services/ObjectStorage/os_constructing.html) URL.

Now, you're ready to manage [objects](/docs/services/ObjectStorage/os_managing.html) and [access](/docs/services/ObjectStorage/os_security.html).

To learn more about how the service works, see [About Object Storage](/docs/services/ObjectStorage/os_works_public.html).
