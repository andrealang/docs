## Unrecognized token contentpack returned when using openstack4J with Liberty Profile
{: #unrecognized_token}


The following stacktrace might occur when using openstack4j with the Liberty Profile:
```
Exception thrown by application class 'org.openstack4j.connectors.okhttp.HttpResponseImpl.readEntity:124'
org.openstack4j.api.exceptions.ClientResponseException: Unrecognized token 'contentpack': was expecting ('true', 'false' or 'null') at [Source: contentpack ; line: 1, column: 12]

{: tsSymptoms}


This problem results from a class-loading issue, where the openstack4j library contains some of the same packages that are provided in the Liberty profile.  For example, OpenStack4j uses JERSEY, which might collide with the Wink libs.
{: tsCauses}


You can fix this problem by either:
{: tsResolve}
  * Using reverse classloading (parentLast).
  * Excluding jaxrs from the enabled features.
