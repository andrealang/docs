  <ul>
  <li>To create a parallel group, click the **Parallel** button <img class="inline" src="images/para-icon.png"  alt="parallel group button">. If you cannot create a parallel group with the selected tasks, the button is disabled. You might not be able to create a parallel group if all the selected tasks are already in a parallel group, for example.
  </li>
  <li>To create a sequential group, click the **Sequential** button <img class="inline" src="images/seq-icon.png"  alt="sequential group button">.

  </ul>

The group is formed and a **group select bar** is added to the deployment plan. If you selected discontiguous tasks, the tasks form a contiguous list starting with the topmost selected task.

The following figure shows a parallel group. The **group select bar** identifies the type of group: parallel <img class="inline" src="images/para-select.png"  alt="parallel group select">, or sequential <img class="inline" src="images/seq-select.png"  alt="sequential group select">.
