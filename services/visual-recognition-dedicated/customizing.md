# Guidelines for training classifiers
{: #classifier}

After you classify an image and create, train, and query a custom classifier with the example data in the [Creating a custom classifier tutorial](tutorial-custom-classifier.html), you will want to classify your own data or create your own custom classifier.
{: shortdesc}

## Default classifier categories
{: #default-classifiers}

The default classifier returns classes from thousands of possible tags organized into categories and subcategories. The following list shows the top-level categories:

- Animals (including birds, reptiles, amphibians, etc.)

- Person and people-oriented information and activities

- Food (including cooked food and beverages)

- Plants (including trees, shrubs, aquatic plants, vegetables)

- Sports

- Nature (including many types of natural formations, geological structures)

- Transportation (land, water, air)

- And many more, including furnishings, fruits, musical instruments, tools, colors, gadgets, devices, instruments, weapons, buildings, structures and man-made objects, clothing and garments, and flowers, among others.

### Classify response hierarchy
{: notoc}

The `/v3/classify` method classifies images within a hierarchy of related classes. For example, a picture of a Beagle might be classified as "animal" as well as the related "dog" and "beagle". A positive match with the related classes, in this case "dog" and "beagle", boosts the score of the parent response. In this example, the response includes all three classes: "animal", "dog", and "beagle". The score of the parent class ("animal") is boosted because it matches the related classes ("dog" and "beagle"). The parent is also a "type\_hierarchy" to show that it is a parent of the hierarchy.

## Structure of the training data
{: #structure}

A custom classifier is a group of classes that are trained against each other. This allows you to create a multi-faceted classifier that can identify highly specialized subjects, while also providing a score for each individual class.

During classifier training, classes are created when you upload separate compressed (.zip) files of positive examples for each class. For example, to create a classifier called "fruit", you might upload a .zip file of images of pears, a .zip file of images of apples, and a .zip file of images of bananas in a single training call.

You can also provide a .zip file of negative examples in the same training call to further hone your classifier. Negative example files are not used to create a class. For the custom classifier "fruit", you might provide a .zip file with images of various vegetables.

After training completes, when the service identifies fruit in an image, it will return the classifier "fruit" as an array containing the classes "pears", "apples", and "bananas" with their respective confidence scores.

**Important**: The `POST /v3/classifiers` training call requires that you provide at least two example .zip files: two positive examples files, or one positive examples file and one negative examples file.

Custom classifiers are only accessible to the specific service instance where they were created and cannot be shared with other {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} users who do not have access to your instance of the service.

## Updating custom classifiers
{: #update-classifier}

You can update an existing classifier by adding new classes, or by adding new images to existing classes. To update the existing classifier, use several compressed (.zip) files, including files containing positive or negative images (.jpg, or .png). You must supply at least one compressed file, with additional positive or negative examples.

Compressed files containing positive examples are used to create and update "classes" to impact all of the classes in that classifier. The prefix that you specify for each positive example parameter is used as the class name within the new classifier. The "\_positive\_examples" suffix is required. There is no limit on the number of positive example files you can upload in a single call.

The compressed file containing negative examples is not used to create a class within the created classifier, but does define what the updated classifier is not. Negative example files should contain images that do not depict the subject of any of the positive examples. You can only specify one negative example file in a single call.

### How retraining works
{: notoc}

If you train a classifier with three sets of positive class pictures - Apples, Bananas, and Pears - the system trains three models internally. For the Apples model, the group of pictures in "Apples" is trained as a positive example, and the group of pictures uploaded in "Bananas" and "Pears" are trained as negative examples. The system then knows that bananas and pears are not apples. The other classes are used as negative examples for the Bananas, and Pears models as well.

Next, say you want to retrain your classifier with new positive classes: YellowPears and GreenPears. In order to do this, you'll need to manually look through your old pears.zip folder, and split the images out into two new folders: YellowPears.zip and GreenPears.zip.

**Important:** Splitting a class definition via retraining is possible, but it calls for great care in organizing the data. You must submit the **exact** same image files to the new folders - no resizing or anything - that you used during the original training. For example, when creating YellowPears or GreenPears, every single yellow pear image from the original pears.zip training set should be exactly copied into the YellowPears.zip folder; otherwise, any image that is not copied exactly will be in the Pears training set, and used as a negative when YellowPears is trained.

Now, you simply retrain the system with YellowPears.zip and GreenPears.zip as positive examples. When you do this, the system recognizes the exact duplicate images in the YellowPears and GreenPears folders from the original pears.zip folder, and those images are retrained as positive examples for their new classes. The rule is that a duplicate image is kept in the positive set, if it is also found in both the negative and positive set for a class.

The end result is that the YellowPears and GreenPears classes will have Apples and Bananas as negative examples, but will not have any exact duplicate images from the Pears class as negative examples.

## Size limitations
{: #size-limits}

There are size limitations for training calls and data:

- The service accepts a maximum of 10,000 images or 100 MB per .zip file

- The service requires a minimum of 10 images per .zip file.

- The service accepts a maximum of 256 MB per training call.

- Minimum recommend size of an image is 32X32 pixels.

There are also size limitations for classification calls:

- The `POST /v3/classify` methods accept a maximum of 20 images per batch.

- The `POST /v3/detect_faces` methods accept a maximum of 15 images per batch.

## Guidelines for good training
{: #good-training}

The following guidelines are not enforced by the API. However, the service tends to perform better when the training data adheres to them:

- A minimum of 50 images is recommended in each .zip file, as fewer than 50 images can decrease the quality of the trained classifier.

- If the quality and content of training data is the same, then classifiers that are trained on more images will generally be more accurate than classifiers that are trained on fewer images. The benefits of training a classifier on more images plateaus at around 5000 images, and this can take a while to process. You can train a classifier on more than 5000 images, but it may not significantly increase that classifier's accuracy.

- Uploading a total of 150-200 images per .zip file gives you the best balance between the time it takes to train and the improvement to classifier accuracy. More than 200 images increases the time, and it does increase the accuracy, but with diminishing returns for the amount of time it takes.

- Include approximately the same number of images in each examples file. Including an unequal number of images can cause the quality of the trained classifier to decline.

- The accuracy of your custom classifier can be affected by the kinds of images you provide to train it. Provide example images that are similar to the images you plan to analyze. For example, if you are training the classifier "tiger", your classifier might be less accurate if you provide only images of tigers in a zoo taken by a mobile phone to train the classifier, but you want to test the classifier on images of tigers in the wild taken by professional photographers.

## Guidelines for high volume classifying
{: #high-volume}

If you want to classify many images, submitting one image at a time can take a long time. You can maximize efficiency and performance of the service in the following ways:

- Resize images to be no larger than 320 pixels in either width or height. Images do not need to be high resolution.

- Submit images in batches as compressed (.zip) files.

- Specify only the classifiers you want results for in the `classifier_ids` parameter. If you do not specify a value for this parameter, the service classifies the images against the default classifier and takes longer to return a response.

## Custom classifier scores
{: #scores}

The `/classify` method produces a score between 0.0 and 1.0 for each image for each class. This section delves into the meaning of those scores for custom classifiers (as opposed to the default classifier).

### Background reading
{: notoc}

- The service performs [statistical classification ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification){:new_window}.

- You can [measure statistical classifiers ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Information_retrieval_evaluation){:new_window} in several ways.

### How to use the scores
{: notoc}

- Think about possible actions to be taken in response to a classification. Specifically, analyze how you will use "true" or "false" positive or negative conditions.  These conditions are described in the Background Reading.

- This cost-benefit balance is crucial to deciding what to do with each class score, and only someone who understands the final application can determine it. The score value needed for the application to take some action is called the "decision threshold." The service does not compute this for you.

- Custom classifiers use binary "one versus the rest" models to train each class against the other classes. The system assumes that two classes within a classifier cannot occur at the same time, so you should create separate classifiers to test for classes that can exist together, like `blue` and `sky`. Alternatively, you could create a distinct classifier for cases where both classes exist at the same time and test for a class like `blueSky`.

### Example
{: notoc}

Imagine that you are monitoring an assigned parking space with a webcam. You train a custom classifier to recognize whether your car is in the spot, some other car is in the spot, the spot is empty, or the camera has been blocked. You collect training examples for each of these cases and train a custom classifier with four classes. Your application classifies images from the webcam to report the status of the spot, and the system notifies you with a message if the status is unexpected. Each time the service classifies the image from the camera, it produces four scores: `myCar`, `unknownCar`, `emptySpot`, and `blockedCamera`.

The first action to consider is whether to send a notification.

Suppose you park in your spot and have the service start classifying the images. You see the `myCar` score computed as 0.8 on average over a few hours, while the `unknownCar` score hovers around 0.3, `emptySpot` is around 0.15 and `blockedCamera` is around 0.1. Given this data, you write your code to notify you if the `myCar` score is less than 0.75, or if one of the others is greater than 0.6. During the day, you get about one false alarm every three hours when people walk by and obscure the car. The system sends you the photo along with the notice, so you can see it's nothing to worry about. That seems fine, but then at night those false alarms every three hours get very annoying! Your preferences for day vs. night notification reflect the higher cost of a false alarm at night time for your application.

So, the notification logic and threshold will probably vary, depending on the perceived risk of car theft, the accuracy of your classifiers, and the amount of annoyance caused by a false alarm.

Similarly, as a person, you may face the same trade-off. If the system notifies you that the camera has been blocked, the accompanying image will likely simply be all black or gray. Do you go to check on the car in person or ignore it? Again, this depends on your other priorities and the perceived risks.

### Questions
{: notoc}

**What do the scores mean?**

- The scores are comparable indicators, with a range from 0.0 to 1.0. You can compare the scores of two custom classes (from the same or different classifiers) on the same or different images, and the higher one should be more likely to appear in the image than the lower one. However, they may both be present. It is best to pick a decision threshold for each class individually.

- The custom classifier scores are not comparable to the scores returned by the default classifier (which has `classifier\_id: "default"`)

- The service attempts to normalize the score output so that 0.5 is a good decision threshold. By default, scores below 0.5 are not reported in the results of `/classify`. You can override this behavior by setting the threshold parameter of the `/classify` method. This normalization is only computed on the training data, so with new data or different application contexts, you might find that a different threshold works better.

- The scores are unitless and are neither percentages nor probabilities. (They do not add up to 100% or 1.0).

**Why do I get scores between 0.5 and 0.6 for images that I would expect to return a high score, near 1.0?**

- You might get lower scores if there is a significant amount of similarity between your classes, so that in the feature space your examples are not in distinct clusters, and the scores reflect this closeness to the best boundary between positives and negatives that the system could learn.

**How can I evaluate the accuracy of a custom classifier for my use case?**

There are many ways to do this, here is one:

1. Assemble a set of labeled images "L" that was not used in training the classifier.

2. Split L into two sets, V and T - validation and testing.

3. Run V through your classifier and pick a score threshold "R" which optimizes the correctness metric you value, such as top-5 precision, across all of V.

4. From T, select a random subset "Q" and classify it using your classifier and "R". Compute the probability of a correct classification on Q. That's one experiment.

5. Repeat step 4 with a different subset Q from T, then compute the average % correct across all experiments.
